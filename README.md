# For_IAIFI_Summer_School
This repository provides a sample of my code from both previous and ongoing projects. They do not have descriptive comments on purpose, some files lack finalized model architectures due to either patent restrictions or their ongoing development for a research paper.

This repository is not intended to reflect my typical workflow; its sole purpose is to showcase exemplary machine learning code.
